## Technologies 

The places have been automatically extracted using [Stanford](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html) and [Freeling](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling), Named Entity Recognizers, and geolocated with the R package [```editio/georeference```](https://github.com/editio/georeference), develop for this project. The final data has been refined manually.

The georeference and tiling of historical maps used [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org). They are hosted in a github repository [```editio/tiles```](https://github.com/editio/tiles) and served through URLs in the XYZ source format (zoom level and tile grid coordinates).

This site, the maps, the statistics and visualizations are build with [R](https://www.r-project.org) within the [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) environment, using mostly the packages [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet).
